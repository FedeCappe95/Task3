# Task3

**University of Pisa, April 2020**

This service is part of a university project in *Large-scale and multi-structured databases*
Inspired by the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the aim of the project is to track the movement of a large number of people and calculate a risk index for each of them based on their movements with complete respect for privacy.
More specifically
- a risk index can be calculated for each user,
- a risk index can be calculated for each place registered for the service (based on the physical characteristics of the place and visitor statistics),
- users can be informed about which places are to be avoided and which are preferable.

All the required computations are performed efficiently thanks to a database organization created specifically for the purpose. The use of a graph database (Neo4J) is, in this context, the key to the realization of the system.
The expected mobile client application was not created. Instead, a demonstrative but complete desktop client was built in Java.
